# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mario's Cousin Carlos	

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I plan to build the game inspired by Mario that is part of Harvard's CS50. The game features a blue alien that I will call Carlos.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I had originally planed to create a line following robot with a Raspberry Pi. The ongoing supply chain issues have made sourcing and ordering materials more difficult than I thought. In an effort to streamline my project and not rely on anyone else, I've decided to build this game! The project will feature colorful graphics and raster grapics. The avitar will be able to jump and hit block that are floating in the air like the original Mario game. What'll be intersting is figuiring out how to use lua and working with the annimation of the characrter. The CS50 project also gets into procedural generation, allowing the user to go through different levels. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I do not plan to combine this final project with another

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I do not plan on collaborating with other classmates

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be having a game that works. The player may have some movement but maybe extras like sound/music and extra text may not be game critical. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be to have the player move the character about. I'm interested in learning about the jump velocity and gravity variables in this CS50 project and I feel like those are must haves. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to have a beautiful game with sound effects. Hopefully I have time to get to this point becuase there's no dout that music in modern gaming makes or breaks the game. Take Red Dead Redemtion 2 for example. An amazing score. I am in no way comparing my game to RDR2 but I want to aim for having a sound track in my game. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps in the process will be to continue to do research on the CS50 page: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/games/#:~:text=Player%20class,%20we%E2%80%99ll%20check%20for%20tiles%20that%20we%E2%80%99re%20moving%20into%20or%20below%20us.%20If%20we%E2%80%99re%20walking%20and%20there%20is%20no%20tile%20beneath%20us,%20we%E2%80%99ll%20need%20a%20spe
I want to go though some of the videos to get an understanding of what the final project needs to look like and what I want it to look like. From there I just need to follow allong with the videos and see where I can add my own personal touch to the game.
