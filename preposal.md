# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I plan to create a robot with a Raspberry Pi that follows a line on a piece of paper -- https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-python-line-following

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

n/a - Working alone

## Do you have any questions of your own?


This'll be my first time working with a Raspberry Pi so I thinkg a lot of the questions I have will be answered once I start building everything
